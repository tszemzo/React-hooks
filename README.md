## React Advanced Course

This repository contains different small projects I've done during the React Frontend Advanced Course gave by @Course[It]: https://courseit.com.ar/

We cover the following topics:

* Quick nivelation: state, props, lifecycle, clean architecture principles, dumb/smart components
* Hooks: why, motivation; HooksRules, useState, useRef (dangerous), useEffect (performance issues of repainting)
* Custom Hooks

The duration of the course was almost ~ 25hs.
