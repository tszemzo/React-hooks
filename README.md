## React Advanced Course

This repository contains different small projects I've done during the React Frontend Advanced Course gave by @Course[It]: https://courseit.com.ar/

We cover the following topics:

* **Quick nivelation:** state, props, lifecycle, clean architecture principles, dumb/smart components
* **Hooks:** why, motivation; HooksRules, useState, useRef (dangerous), useEffect (performance issues of repainting)
* **Custom Hooks**

The duration of the course was almost ~ 25hs.

I took some quick notes about it (in spanish): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtiH1Xhxh-C9Ec3W4b2GooPL65c0JI55My_Sq_k3l2Q/edit?usp=sharing
